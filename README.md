A friend of mine having an event and would like attendees to register themselves using QR code printed on their IDs. There will be registration desks where you can grab smart device and scan the QR code with, and the app. will set the exact time the attendee registered in the event.

The dashboard created to import attendees list, check time each attendee registered and export data as well.

This is my very first react application, and I'm trying my best to understand the basic concept and put them into application. If you have seen something that should be written in a better way, or something to avoid, it's highly appreciated to drop me a line, I'd really love that!
